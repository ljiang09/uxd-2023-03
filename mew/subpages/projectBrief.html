    <h1>Project Brief</h1>

    <h2>What is the problem in brief?</h2>
    <p>
      If you’re a young professional in a new city, finding and making new
      friends can be difficult, especially if you’re a remote worker. Our
      project would help prevent isolation and promote making new connections.
    </p>

    <h2>How will your project change the status quo? For whom?</h2>
    <p>
      Currently, the status quo is that young professionals who work remotely
      often spend a lot of time alone. In-person workers can naturally make
      friends through their office environment, but remote/hybrid workers don’t
      have this opportunity. They also might be in a new city or situation and
      don’t have a good way to make new connections. A lot of people also use
      dating apps as a way to meet new friends, which can be confusing for those
      who are on dating apps solely to date.
      <br />
      With our project, most people would have a natural way to meet new people
      they might be interested in befriending. It would promote casual hangouts
      with the intention of becoming friends.

    <h2>
      What is (at least) one naïve design idea (rough sketch)? How does this
      idea address what you see as the core problem?
    </h2>
    <p>
      We’ve come up with a couple of ideas. First, we thought about making a
      Tinder-style friend app, with the swipe left/swipe right system; however,
      we felt like that was too similar to the dating app space we were trying
      to break out of.
      <br />
      Our second idea was to create an app that shows a map of events in your
      area. You could indicate if you were going to an event (so your friends
      could join you) and post your own events if you wanted to host something.
      Additionally, if you wanted to host something smaller and more personal,
      you could post an event only to your “friends”, which would be people
      you’ve met before and mutually add each other as friends. Another idea is
      that each person can create “groups” of friends as people often have
      different groups with different interests, and they can post events only
      to certain groups. There could be some default hangout suggestions for new
      connections who don’t know each other’s interests well, such as cooking
      meals together, music jam sessions, or playing pickleball.
    </p>

    <h2>
      What information do you need to collect? How will you collect it? How will
      you meet your target users, or who can serve as effective proxies for
      them?
    </h2>
    <p>
      We need to talk to young professionals who prefer to work from home and
      feel isolated in their city. We have older siblings/cousins that can put
      us in contact with these types of people or we could reach out to recent
      Olin alumni that could experience this.
    </p>

    <h2>
      How will your team work together to accomplish these goals (as well as
      your individual learning goals)?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our team will work to talk to at least 8 people to understand their
      experiences of being in a new city and the challenges they face. After
      interviewing the people’s experiences, we will reflect on whether or not
      our original idea/product may or may not work.
