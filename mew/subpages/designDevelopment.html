    <h1>Design Development Report</h1>

    <h2>Ideation</h2>
    <p>
      We started this phase by brainstorming a bunch of features we thought were
      crucial to the app's development.
    </p>

    <p>
      After discussing the ideas generated by brainstorming, we decided that a
      key feature of our app was the "events page" where people could see events
      happening in their area and get connected to others who are going to that
      event. We individually worked on sketches
      (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ym3gqsWg7vn6HRZOnQ9eyp0pqVya5FXD?usp=sharing)
      for what we thought this page should look like and in our next team
      meeting, we all shared our sketches with each other. After going through
      all the designs, we discussed the parts we liked about each of them and
      chose a design to move forward with. In that meeting, we all sketched
      (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d3eafclfbWz4SXFMYBDaOrg16KJOFr5d?usp=sharing)
      out designs for another key feature of our app, the chat feature, in the
      style of the design we moved forward with. Once again, we shared our
      sketches as a group, discussed what we liked about them, and chose a
      design to move forward with.
    </p>

    <h2>Storyboarding</h2>
    <img src="../media/Brainstorm.jpg" alt="Brainstorm" width="700" />
    <p>
      After choosing designs to move forward with, we began to storyboard the
      actual interaction flow of our app. We had decided on the key features of
      the app, but we weren't sure how they'd all fit together. In the image,
      you can see our workflow of interactions the user could have with the app.
      First, they need to log in or sign up for the app. If you are signing up
      for the first time, you then need to make a profile and you can go through
      a tutorial, explaining how the app works. After you complete the tutorial,
      you will be led to your home page. If you are logging in, and already have
      a profile, you'll automatically be redirected to the home page once you've
      logged in. From the home page, you can access the events page, your
      calendar of events you're going to, your chats, your friends list, and
      your profile. The events page will have various events in your area
      encased in bubbles, which are sized proportionally to what the app thinks
      your interest in the event is. We give the users the ability to fine-tune
      their preferences by making the bubbles larger or smaller based on their
      interests. The app will adjust the bubble sizes of the events it suggests
      accordingly. Users also have the ability to create a new event and after
      events, they can leave a review of the event, giving feedback to the
      people who host events.
    </p>

    <h2>What is your design?</h2>
    <p>
      Our design concept aims to address the challenge of forging new
      friendships in a new city for young professionals, particularly those
      working remotely. The current reality for remote workers often involves
      extended periods of solitude as they adapt to a new environment. While
      in-office employees have opportunities to cultivate connections through
      their workplace, remote young professionals must seek companions who are
      at a similar stage in life through other methods. One such method is using
      dating apps to make friends, which confuses those who use these platforms
      exclusively for romantic purposes. Our app offers a solution by providing
      a dedicated platform for individuals seeking new connections within their
      city, with an emphasis on platonic relationships and shared experiences.
      We started our design process with individual sketches
      (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ym3gqsWg7vn6HRZOnQ9eyp0pqVya5FXD?usp=sharing),
      which we then shared in a team meeting. After going through everyone’s
      designs, we discussed what we liked about them and chose a primary design
      to move forward with. We then took the style of that design and created
      feature sketches of the chat function of our app
      (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d3eafclfbWz4SXFMYBDaOrg16KJOFr5d?usp=sharing).
      After sharing those sketches, we again chose one to move forward with and
      began implementing our designs in Figma
      (https://www.figma.com/file/ah5c2ECtIDtREyY2t8G8or/UXD?type=design&node-id=1%3A2&mode=design&t=mj0mnKsVbMR9nuIN-1).
      While creating our designs in Figma, we began to decide on a color scheme
      and fonts and began to figure out the organization of all the elements
      that needed to be part of our design.

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>
      (Flow chart) Our app works by presenting users with potential social
      events happening near them. The user can cater the events they see to
      their interests by specifying preferences, and select which events they
      want to attend. They then can join a chat with other users also interested
      in that event, allowing them to talk to and hang out with people with
      similar passions. While other apps are limited only to “matching” people
      together, often resulting in no actual conversation besides icebreakers or
      a ‘hello,’ our format allows users to jump right to the stage of prepping
      to go to an activity and meet people in advance. Users will be able to
      successfully get out and meet more people, as the activation energy is
      much lower than trying to pick and choose between people who you have to
      make plans with from scratch.
    </p>

    <h2>How well does it meet user needs? In what ways does it fall short?</h2>
    <p>
      Our user-centric app is designed to cater to a wide range of needs. It
      empowers users to create comprehensive profiles that include photos,
      personal information, interests, and a brief bio, ensuring they can
      express themselves fully. Our matching algorithm goes a step further,
      suggesting potential friends based on events and interests. We give users
      the ability to fine-tune their preferences with our unique “bubbles”
      feature, allowing them to increase or decrease their social interest
      according to their comfort level. We enable secure messaging within the
      app, providing a safe environment for users to communicate with potential
      friends via text messaging. Additionally, our app fosters a sense of
      community by allowing users to join or create groups and communities based
      on their interests and hobbies, thus fostering shared passions and
      meaningful connections. Our system also includes a feature that encourages
      users to leave reviews of their experience with the app, as well as their
      thoughts on its features and user experience. This feedback loop helps us
      continuously improve and provide a better service to our users. To keep
      users engaged, we've incorporated gamification elements such as the use of
      “bubbles” to incentivize continued participation and interaction. However,
      we acknowledge that there are some shortcomings in our app. It requires an
      additional download, which might be a minor inconvenience for some users.
      Furthermore, we understand that individuals with dexterity problems might
      face challenges when using the app – using the pinching motion to make a
      bubble bigger or smaller – and actively working to make it more accessible
      to all.
    </p>

    <h2>
      What important alternative designs did you consider, either initially or
      during the refinement of this idea? Why did you reject them/prefer the one
      you chose?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Initially, we were thinking of a more traditional people-matching app,
      but, after gathering some information about our user group’s experiences
      with dating apps and friendship apps formatted, we decided to pivot. There
      are a lot of underlying expectations and biases directing people’s use of
      people-matching apps. Often things like someone’s appearance, or how funny
      their bio one-liner is, completely sways a user’s opinion of them- even if
      they’re just looking for new friends near them. This inhibits users who
      struggle to represent themselves through pictures- or even don’t want to
      post pictures of themselves publicly online- and a few brief words from
      matching with others. By matching people with events, there's less
      pressure on users to try to present themselves “desirably” to get matches.
      Their profiles can be tailored to however they are comfortable presenting
      themselves as opposed to needing to fit into the tastes of those they want
      to match since it’s about choosing events- not people. It also mitigates
      users' biases surrounding appearance matching even if unintentional out of
      habit from using dating apps rather than friend-finding apps.
    </p>

    <h2>
      What key insights did you gain in trying to produce a design that
      addresses your brief?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Building and maintaining meaningful friendships is fundamentally rooted in
      the shared experiences and memories we create with others. It’s not just
      about meeting new people, but about what we do together. Rather than
      solely focusing on the question, “Who can I meet today?” it’s often more
      rewarding to consider, “What am I doing today?” The quality and depth of a
      friendship are often a reflection of the time spent together and the
      moments shared. It’s about valuing the present moment and the connections
      you already have rather than solely seeking out new people to meet. It’s
      important to engage in activities and experiences with people, rather than
      reducing them to mere social connections. It’s a reminder to value
      individuals for who they are and not just for their potential utility in
      expanding your social network. People appreciate interactive and engaging
      experiences with others, as genuine interaction, participation in
      activities, and meaningful conversations are key elements in building
      strong and lasting friendships. In essence, friendships are formed and
      nurtured through the bonds created by experiencing life together.
