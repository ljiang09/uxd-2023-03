          <h2>Final Report</h2>
          <h3>Unions</h3>
          <p>
            The Animation Guild (TAG) stands as a testament to the
            transformative power of collective efforts in the animation
            industry. Using TAG as a blueprint, the team can lay a strong
            foundation for their project, which aims to uplift independent
            animators. Here's how:
          </p>
          <p>Solidarity and Unity:</p>
          <p>
            TAG boasts a storied legacy of championing animators' rights, from
            brokering improved working conditions to guaranteeing equitable pay.
            Their platform can act as a beacon for independent animators,
            championing their needs and rights. The Guild's proactive approach
            to negotiate terms for streaming television, an emerging medium,
            reflects adaptability and vision.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            The American Animation Institute, birthed by TAG, is dedicated to
            disseminating knowledge about the animation craft. Their platform
            can proffer resources, tutorials, and workshops, assisting animators
            in honing their skills and aligning with industry benchmarks.
          </p>
          <p>
            TAG's routine membership assemblies and the democratic election of
            an Executive Board accentuate the essence of active community
            participation. Their platform can facilitate regular dialogues,
            feedback rounds, and potentially even elections for community
            figureheads or representatives.
          </p>
          <p>
            TAG's emphasis on collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) ensures
            the safeguarding of animators' rights. While their platform might
            not delve into formal CBAs, it can furnish resources or templates
            for contract negotiations, ensuring animators receive fair
            compensation and their rights remain intact.
          </p>
          <p>
            TAG's endeavors to broaden its jurisdiction, transitioning from
            traditional animation to computer graphics and from local to global
            studios, underscore the importance of adaptability. Their platform
            can be inclusive, accommodating diverse forms of animation and
            welcoming animators from varied backgrounds and locales.:
          </p>
          <p>
            TAG extends financial aid resources and addresses workplace
            concerns, prioritizing members' well-being. Their platform can
            feature a dedicated support segment, be it financial, mental health
            resources, or addressing workplace disputes. TAG's collaborations
            with a plethora of animation studios present members with a myriad
            of opportunities. Their platform can bridge independent animators
            with potential clients, studios, or collaborators, paving the way
            for new horizons.

          <h3>Newgrounds</h3>
          <p>
            Newgrounds is a website that describes itself as “a community of
            artists, game developers, musicians, voice actors and writers who
            create and share some of the best stuff on the web”. On this site,
            the user's art is the center of attention. The design of the website
            itself is dark and simple, drawing the eye immediately to the art.
            Showcasing art is not the only way this website aims to foster
            community. On the left side of the main page, there is a list of
            upcoming events. These events include meetups and art collaboration
            opportunities. Our project will take inspiration from Newgrounds by
            ensuring that the art work is our priority, and by making community
            building events and opportunities as accessible as possible.
          </p>

          </div>
          <p style="text-align: center">Newgrounds homepage</p>
          <p>
            Not only does it showcase the work of artists, but it also operates
            as a form of social media & networking. Social media plays a large
            role in the lives of independent artists as it provides them with a
            platform to share their work and get inspiration from others. That
            means it is important for a community building site such as
            Newgrounds to function as a social media site as well. Users can
            comment on and interact with artwork, follow friends and artists
            they like, share news with each other, and send private messages.
            All of these elements foster community. There is even a point system
            built into the site that encourages interacting with content and
            posting your own. You can level up, increase in rank, and gain XP
            points, all of which aids in the building of community.
          </p>
          <p>
            The site is easy to navigate. You can upload your own art with a few
            clicks of a button, making it easy to engage. If you want to foster
            community, you need to make the tools to do so as accessible and
            intuitive as possible so you are inviting people to engage, not
            scaring them away. New grounds is an excellent site to showcase the
            art of community building, especially in the independent artist
            community.

          <h3>Zola</h3>
          <p>
            Zola is a very popular wedding planning website which offers
            multiple different services for couples planning their wedding.
          </p>
          <div style="text-align: center">
            <img width="400" src="images/image6.png" />
          </div>
          <p style="text-align: center">Menu of different services offered</p>
          <p>
            This was one part of the website that I thought was really good for
            us to draw inspiration from for a few different reasons. First, we
            also want to offer a variety of services so that our platform would
            be comprehensive and essentially be a one-stop shop for planning.
            Second, this gives a good idea of how to quickly advertise our
            services to people so that the value is concise and clear.
          </p>

          <div style="text-align: center">
            <img width="400" src="images/image8.png" />
          </div>
          <p style="text-align: center">
            Vendor lists for various aspects of wedding planning
          </p>
          <p>
            Another interesting aspect of this site is the customization
            features. Not only do they have multiple quizzes which the user can
            take to filter down their vendor options, they also have an
            extensive database of potential vendors for people along with their
            prices. In a way they're giving their user a checklist and then all
            the means to ensure that the list is accomplished.
          </p>
          <div style="text-align: center">
            <img width="400" src="images/image2.png" />
          </div>
          <p style="text-align: center">
            Booking option for advice from their experts.
          </p>
          <p>
            While they do have a ton of free options related to planning, they
            do also offer more specific expert advice for people who might want
            more help than being given a list of vendors to explore. This is an
            interesting idea for us to explore as having a staff that
            specializes in event planning or co-op organization might be a big
            asset. This is a paid service through Zola and a big part of what we
            want to do is cut costs for these smaller organizations so we would
            need to think of a different way to fund that.
          </p>
          <h3>Boston film/Animation festivals</h3>
          <p>
            Boston already has a thriving community of small, mid sized and
            large film festivals catering to both film and animators.
          </p>
          <div style="text-align: center">
            <img width="400" src="images/image1.png" />
          </div>
          <div style="text-align: center">
            <img width="400" src="images/image4.png" />
          </div>
          <p>
            The boston film festival has been held annually since 1985, and has
            hosted work from many famous filmmakers including Jodie Foster, Al
            Pacino, Tommy Lee Jones, and Ridley Scott. It's structured More
            recently, there a several smaller and more locally based film
            festivals throughout Boston, catering towards niches.
          </p>
          <h3>Grassroots Community Organizing</h3>
          <p>
            Even though our focus in UXD is primarily on website design, I
            believe there are a lot of things we can learn from organizations
            that are doing the in-person version of what we&rsquo;re trying to
            accomplish. Since our ideas surround building community with
            animators I thought it would be interesting to look at an
            organization doing community organizing work in Boston, specifically
            the Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative (DSNI). According to their
            website, DSNI &ldquo;<strong
              >empower[s] residents of the Dudley Neighborhood of Roxbury and
              North Dorchester</strong
            >
            <strong
              >to organize, plan for, create and control a vibrant, diverse and
              high-quality neighborhood in collaboration with community
              partners.</strong
            >&rdquo;<strong> </strong>Part of what makes DSNI so successful is
            that they were created by the same people who they were trying to
            help. This allowed them to gain the trust of the people they wanted
            to work with which led to creating change that was well received
            because it so deeply reflected the desires of the community. I think
            this is a key principle to remember as we embark on our work;
            include the user at the core of our product in a meaningful way that
            gives them real power to influence our platform. I also think we can
            learn something about how DSNI scales. They started small and built
            up to big change. This is a good reminder for us to think about the
            scope of our project and the kinds of interactions we hope to foster
            knowing that there is more we can grow to do more if desired by our
            users. We will grow with our users.&nbsp;
